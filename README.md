# TrendingMovies
One of my first android practices, please read below to find out what the app needs to do and use, feel free to try to develop it before watching at the code.

## Task description:

Create a mobile app in android with java that will display a list of trending movies and will allow the user to filter, rate and share titles. Tapping on a title will display the movie details on a different screen.

## Make use of:

### - API themoviedb.org (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/trending/get-trending)
### - User Android API target 28
### - Volley for API consumption 
### - Glide for image download and caching
### - Two activities (All movies, movie detail)
### - Use Fragments
### - Use Constraint Layouts
### - Use RecyclerView for lists
### - Use Room, ViewModel and LiveData to handle data
