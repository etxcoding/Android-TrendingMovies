# TrendingMovies
One of my first android practices, go to README file.

## Use Case:

Create a mobile app in android with java that will display a list of trending movies and will allow the user to filter, rate and share titles. Tapping on a title will display the movie details on a different screen.

## MIR:

### API themoviedb.org (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/trending/get-trending)
### User Android API target 28
### Volley for API consumption 
### Glide for image download and caching
### Two activities (All movies, movie detail)
### Use Fragments
### Use Constraint Layouts
### Use RecyclerView for lists
### Use Room, ViewModel and LiveData to handle data
